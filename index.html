        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <div class="about-text">
          <p>
            Welcome! My name is Carrie Gonzales, founder of CEG Wellness. I have
            over 15 years of clinical experience as a registered dietitian and I
            am also an Integrative Health Coach.
          </p>
          <p>
            After many years of struggling to manage PCOS and its associated
            symptoms myself, I have decided to share what I have learned with
            others who are struggling with this disorder. PCOS, or Polycystic
            Ovary Syndrome, is an endocrine disorder that affects 10-15% of all
            women. It can lead to complications including infertility, obesity,
            hair and skin issues, anxiety, depression, endometrial cancer, type
            2 diabetes, as well as a host of other conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I struggled for years trying to navigate PCOS, seeking any
            information I could find. It seemed the only information provided by
            medical professionals were recommendations for birth control which
            created other problems for me. A couple of doctors diagnosed me with
            endometriosis, and I was told I would have difficulty getting
            pregnant. It was all very confusing, and it has taken years to find
            my way with PCOS. Perhaps you have experienced similar situations.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent many years researching everything I could find out about
            PCOS. For me, I knew the uncontrolled weight gain was more than a
            diet issue. I advanced my studies to become a certified health
            coach. Through a holistic approach, I have managed to regulate my
            periods without prescription medication, battle cravings, and
            improve my physical and mental well-being. Yes, healthy living with
            PCOS includes a solid nutritional foundation, but equally important
            is addressing lifestyle behaviors.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to help others wade through the confusion of their PCOS
            diagnosis and bring more PCOS awareness in general. Many women are
            silently struggling through this alone and may not even know they
            have this disorder. At this time, there is no cure for PCOS and
            unfortunately there is not a lot of information available about it
            either.

        <h2>Why Should You Work With Me?</h2>
        <p>
          I provide a unique, tailored approach recognizing one-size-fits-all
          does not apply to women with PCOS. In addition, since I have PCOS
          myself, I can relate to the frustration and confusion that goes along
          with this diagnosis. I am also aware that no two women are alike and
          will work collaboratively with you to identify and create your own
          personalized plan. I offer a supportive, judgement-free environment
          where you can feel comfortable sharing your story with me. Together we
          will unlock the pathways to a healthier life.
        </p>
        <h2>My Commitment:</h2>
        <p>
          I am continually educating myself and I work with a network of
          professionals who have the collective goal of bringing PCOS education
          and research to the medical community and women with this disorder.
        </p>
        <h2>What To Expect In Working With Me:</h2>
        <p>
          PCOS takes on many different characteristics. I want to know you
          beyond this disorder. In addition to providing nutrition support,
          together we will target other areas of your life to address overall
          well-being. These include stressors, relationships, career, sleep
          patterns, and beyond.
