        <div class="about-text">
          <p>
            Welcome! My name is Carrie Gonzales, I’m an Author and Registered
            Dietitian and founder of CEG Wellness. I have over 15 years of
            clinical nutrition experience and more recently adding Integrative
            Nutrition Health Coach to my name. Like many women’s journey with
            PCOS, I was diagnosed in my early twenties and provided no education
            other than being handed a prescription for birth control and to come
            back to the doctor when I was ready to have kids.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am one of the 1 in 10 women with PCOS who has spent the last 15
            years wading through confusing PCOS related symptoms of, anxiety,
            depression, abnormal hormone levels, unexpected weight gain, body
            image and self-esteem loss. I have known what it is like to be your
            own personal guinea pig, experimenting with every diet under the
            sun. I’ve battled imposter syndrome, given my extensive nutrition
            background and not being able to “just figure things out”
          </p>
          <p>
            Tired and frustrated to have all this nutrition knowledge but ending
            up in the same vicious PCOS cycle, I decided to challenge what I
            knew. I decided to question beyond what I was putting on my plate. I
            advanced my studies and now a certified health coach. Through a
            holistic approach I have managed to regulate my periods without
            prescription medication, improve my mood, battle cravings, and
            improve self-esteem and physique. Yes, healthy living with PCOS
            includes a solid nutritional foundation, but not without balancing
            out the other areas in your life.

        <h4>What is PCOS?</h4>
        <p>
          Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder that affects
          10-15% of women. PCOS can lead to complications including,
          infertility, obesity, hair and skin issues, anxiety, depression,
          endometrial cancer, type 2 diabetes as well as a host of other
          conditions. At this time, there is no cure for PCOS and working with a
          collaborative trusted team for PCOS management is ideal to help manage
          complications of this disorder.
        </p>
        <h4>Why You Should Work With Me:</h4>
        <p>
          I provide a unique approach of both nutrition education and health
          coaching to optimize your individualized PCOS life. In addition,
          having PCOS myself, I can relate to the frustrations and confusion of
          this disorder. I am also aware in working with women with PCOS, no two
          women are the same and work collaboratively with you to identify your
          best PCOS life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I offer a supportive, judgement free environment, in where I hope you
          find me as a coach, sister and a friend and not “another white coat”
          with fancy titles next to my name. You are the authority of your life
          and I am here to help you remember where you left off.
        </p>
        <h4>What To Expect In Working With Me:</h4>
        <p>
          If you are looking for someone to hand you a meal plan or life plan or
          spend time on Instagram with gimmicky videos with a “one-size fits all
          approach” I’m probably not your gal. If you are tired and exhausted
          with experimenting on yourself and desiring a better quality of life
          and you’re willing to do the work together, then I’m your person. I
          offer both individualized and group coaching. I want to know who you
          are beyond PCOS. I want to know what goes on your plate outside of
          food. We will address your sleep, stressors, hopes, dreams and yes
          there will be plenty of nutrition support too.
